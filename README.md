# electronic measuring technique 
task_1  
The task was to write a program using any tools and / or programming language that would execute in separate tabs  
individual three guidelines:  
  
1.1. Calculation of ng and ng factors for wavelengths from 400nm to 1600nm and generating a dependency graph of these  
wavelength coefficients and the presentation of the results in the table every 10 nm wavelength. 
  
1.2 Calculation of the atmospheric correction when entered by the user:  
• wavelength (nm)  
• dry temperature (degrees C)  
• wet temperature (degrees C)  
• pressure (hPa)  
• the measured length (m)  
The program returns:  
• the atmospheric correction for 1 km with the given conditions  
• atmospheric conditions (mm)  
• correction of the measured length (mm)  
• length corrected (m)  
  
1.3. Calculation of length difference between arc and chord for the interval from 1km to 100km and generating  
a graph showing the change of this difference with distance and presentation of the results in table every 1km.
